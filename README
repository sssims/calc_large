Solution to Project Euler -- program 3.

The tricky part about the problem is it requires division on a number that islarger than 64 bits. I could either divide the number until its divisors are smaller than 64 bits, which would allow me to use a computer on the remaining factors. Or I could write an arbitrarily large number calculator. The former is undesirable because I would have to do the division by hand. This would be fine if I was confident the original number has a divisor smaller than 30 or so. If not, I'll have to long divide on a huge number many times, possibly hundreds of times. Waste of time. Also, the people at Project Euler probably picked a number with high divisors, like a bunch of jerks.
